# hello-world
This is my foray into GitHub...
Wine lover seeking outlets for wine business and writing ideas/ brainstorms. Writing sometimes Dennis Leary-isk with much less profanity and wit. Wine preference leans towards deep garnet colored vin-ordinaire or home made hooch. I have a distaste for 'wine speak', wine should be simple, not something you have to "understand". Too many years removed from a beautiful life in Sonoma and planning our imminent return. Currently headquartered in Wisconsin, self employed or unemployable, take your pick, in online ventures. 'Entrepreneur', even though I find that difficult to spell. Love loud thunder and lightning storms, little warm puppies and vino! Miss my best friend "Cooper"...
